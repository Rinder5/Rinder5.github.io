                    Scribblemancers uses AirConsole to allow players to play with their smartphones. In the game, the players cast spells to try to damage the opponent, while mimicing the spell cast by their opponent to create a counterspell and avoid taking damage from them. The game utilizes a familiarity with password unlock screens to create a game with "H-O-R-S-E" mechanics, with players battling back and forth, trying to create combinations which the other player need to mimic otherwise they will take damage.

                    Mirror uses Photon Networking in Unity to create a cooperative experience. Players are playing as two parts of the same character, and will see different things on their screen. They will need to work together to continue the story and to complete the game.

                    The game has a storytelling focus, so the mechanics are there to assist the story. One player plays as a guide and the subconscious of the character, while the other plays as the actual character, and needs to interact with things in the world. The game makes use of sound and visual cues and effects to elaborate on the world and thoughts of the character, and to create a vivid and engaging experience.

                    Demon Lord Construction Corporation also uses Photon Networking, but in a very different way. In this game, players are demon minions working for the demon lord. They need to place traps around the demon lord's dungeon, in an attempt to inhibit the hero who arrives to fight the demon lord after a certain amount of time passes. This game was designed for drop-in, drop-out multiplayer, as it was anticipating being played at the yearly ETC festival with guests. Due to this, players can start up the game and join the current session in the middle of the game. Players can also leave in the middle of the game, and their traps will stay around.
                </p>
                <p class="project-desc">
                    The hero will always reach the end. Instead of stopping the hero, players are tasked with objects for each level, such as delaying the hero a certain amount of time or forcing the hero through a certain path on their way through the stage. This makes each level strategic, as the players need to work together and help each other complete their ideas otherwise the time spent laying traps might be wasted when the hero walks the wrong way and avoids them.
                </p>
                <p class="project-desc">
                    In addition to the strategic element, the players are slowly building a obstacle course for themselves, as they need to traverse this level to get to areas to continue building traps. This adds a fun, chaotic element as players need to navigate around the traps that their friendly teammates built. This creates an evolving and ever-changing level, which players need to constantly adapt to, be alert to, and pay attention to. Alternatively, players can just walk through traps, still getting to their destination, but much slower.
